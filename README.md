### Problem Statement:

The goal is to create a user-friendly and secure Login/SignUp page that facilitates user authentication and account creation for a web application .
### Implementation Steps

1)Frontend Setup:

Ensure that the existing React.js project named "authflow" is set up and functional.
If not already done, create a Home Page component with "Login" and "SignUp" buttons.
Implement routing using React Router Dom to navigate between the Home Page, SignUp Form, and Login Form.

2)Enhance SignUp Form:

Review the existing SignUpForm component and make sure it includes fields for Email, Username, Password, and Confirm Password.
If not already done, apply validation rules for each field.
Utilize state management for form data using useState.
Ensure the existing integration of "react-google-login" and "react-github-login" for third-party sign-up options is functional.
Review and enhance the validation rules:
All fields are required. Display an error message if any field is left blank.
Email: Must be in a valid email address format.
Username: Must be unique and follow specified username rules.
Password: Must meet complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters, uppercase/lowercase letters).
Confirm Password: Must match the password provided.

3)Sign Up Functionality:

Implement the "Sign Up" button functionality to send user data to the backend (MongoDB).
Ensure bcrypt is used to hash and store passwords securely.
Send Welsome Message using any mail apis  (e.g., Emailjs for email).

4)Enhance Login Form:

Create a separate LoginForm component with fields for Email/Phone and Password.
Implement basic validation for email/phone and password fields.

5)Third-Party Login:

Ensure users can log in using LinkedIn and GitHub accounts using the existing third-party login components.
Login Functionality:

Implement the "Login" button functionality to authenticate users against stored credentials.
Set up JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.

6)OTP Login:

Ensure the existing option for login using OTP is functional.
If not already done, integrate a library like react-otp-input for OTP input.

7)Forgot Password:

If not already done, implement the "Forgot Password" functionality.
Set up a mechanism to send a password reset email.

8)Redirection After Login:

Set up routing to redirect users to a welcome page after successful login.
Create a WelcomePage component for displaying a welcome message.

9)Testing:

Test the entire authentication flow, including sign up, login, third-party login, OTP login, and password reset.
Debug and fix any issues that arise during testing.


### Tools for Implementation

1)React.js for the frontend.
2)React Router Dom for routing.
3)MongoDB for the backend database.
4)Node.js and Express for the backend server.
5)Bcrypt for password hashing.
6)JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.
7)Third-party libraries like Auth0 for additional functionalities.
